## 1st step is o install investpy in case you don't have it already installed, you can use the "install_investpy.bat" file

## 2nd step is to edit the "run_script.bat" file (you can use notepad), change the currency pairs to the ones you want.

## 3rd step is to click "run_script.bat" file, set back and let the script do all the hard work! :)
